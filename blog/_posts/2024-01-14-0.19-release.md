title: 0.19 â€” ergonomic setters and faster reflection

As of today,
version 0.19 of [capnproto-rust](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust)
is [available on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/capnp).

This release includes improved ergnomics and performance,
while also having a notable breaking change involving text fields.


## setter ergonomics

Suppose that we have the following struct defined in a Cap'n Proto schema file:

```
struct Cookie {
  fortune @0 :Text;
  numbers @1 :List(UInt16);
}

```

With capnp-v0.18.0 (the previous release), to populate such a struct you would write Rust code like this:

```rust
let mut message = capnp::message::Builder::new_default();
let mut root: cookie::Builder = message.init_root();
root.set_fortune("This too shall pass.".into());
let mut numbers = root.init_numbers(6);
numbers.set(0, 4);
numbers.set(1, 8);
numbers.set(2, 15);
numbers.set(3, 16);
numbers.set(3, 23);
numbers.set(3, 42);
```

This is rather more verbose than you might hope.
The setter methods `set_fortune()` and `set_numbers()` are geared toward
accepting input from *other* Cap'n Proto messages, rather than
from Rust-native values.
When we want to call `set_fortune()` on a Rust-native `&str`,
we first need to convert it into a `capnp::text::Reader` via the `.into()` method.
Similarly, the `set_numbers()` method wants a `primitive_list::Reader<u16>`,
and there is no easy way for us to get one of those from a Rust-native `&[u16]`.
Therefore, we avoid that method altogether, and instead opt to use `init_numbers()`
and to invidually set each element of the list.


In capnp-v0.19.0, we can instead directly set these fields from Rust-native values:

```rust
let mut message = capnp::message::Builder::new_default();
let mut root: cookie::Builder = message.init_root();
root.set_fortune("This too shall pass.");
root.set_numbers(&[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]);
```

This is possible because the setter methods have been generalized
to accept a value of type `impl SetterInput<T>`, as follows:

```rust

mod cookie {
  impl <'a> Builder<'a> {
    pub fn set_fortune(&mut self, impl SetterInput<capnp::text::Owned>) {
        ...
    }
    pub fn set_numbers(&mut self,
                       impl SetterInput<capnp::primitive_list::Owned<u16>>) {
        ...
    }
  }
}

```

The trait `SetterInput<capnp::text::Owned>` is implemented both by
`capnp::text::Reader` and by `&str`, and
the trait `SetterInput<capnp::primitive_list::Owned<u16>>`
is implemented by both `capnp::primitive_list::Reader<u16>`
and by `&[u16]`.

### breaking change

Unfortunately, this generalization does cause some breakage.
If we did not update the old line
```rust
root.set_fortune("This too shall pass.".into());
```
then it would now gives us a type error:

```
error[E0283]: type annotations needed
...
    = note: multiple `impl`s satisfying `_: SetterInput<capnp::text::Owned>` found in the `capnp` crate:
            - impl<'a> SetterInput<capnp::text::Owned> for &'a String;
            - impl<'a> SetterInput<capnp::text::Owned> for &'a str;
            - impl<'a> SetterInput<capnp::text::Owned> for capnp::text::Reader<'a>;
note: required by a bound in `cookie::Builder::<'a>::set_fortune`

```

The problem is that `.into()` does not know which type to target.
The fix is to remove the `.into()`.

Note that the need for such `.into()` calls was in fact only recently
introduced, in the release of
[version 0.18]({{site.baseurl}}/2023/09/04/0.18-release.html).
Probably we should have
delayed that release until we had a solution like
the present `impl SetterInput` generalization,
thereby minimizing the churn of downstream code.


## faster reflection

The [0.17 release]({{site.baseurl}}/2023/05/08/run-time-reflection.html)
added support for run-time reflection,
including a `DynamicStruct` type that supports
looking up fields by name.
The initial implementation
worked by linearly scanning a struct's fields.
That works fine for small structs, but can
get expensive when there are a large number of fields.

In [#469](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/pull/469),
[@quartox](https://github.com/quartox) updated
the implementation to use binary search,
resulting in a significant performance increase,
and matching the capnproto-c++ implementation.

This change involved add a new field to the static `RawStructSchema` value included
in the generated code for each Cap'n Proto type.
